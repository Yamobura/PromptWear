  garment: {
    jacket: `A jacket is a short coat worn by both men and women. Apart from the suit, the jacket is one of the most important pieces in a man’s wardrobe. If cut and styled well, and if made in a fairly neutral color palette, this versatile piece of outerwear is suitable for both formal and leisure activities. A jacket should never be exaggerated in the shoulder or tight-fitting in the body, but cut proportionately to a man’s height and width in single- or double-breasted versions, with notched lapels or Nehru collar revers. There are countless styles and shapes of jackets through history, but each fits neatly into formal and semiformal styles.`,

    dress: `Visible clothing, costume, or wearing apparel that can indicate a particular style or fashion and reflect prevailing customs about physical appearance.

    pants: `Trousers (British English), slacks, or pants (American, Canadian, and Australian English) are an item of clothing worn from the waist to anywhere between the knees and the ankles, covering both legs separately.

To distinguish them from shorts, trousers may be called "long trousers" in certain contexts such as school uniforms.`,

    skirt: `A skirt is the lower part of a dress or a separate outer garment that covers a person from the waist downwards. At its simplest, a skirt can be a draped garment made out of a single piece of fabric. However, most skirts are fitted to the body at the waist or hips and fuller below, with fullness introduced by darts, gores, pleats, or panels. Modern skirts are usually made of light to mid-weight fabrics, such as denim, jersey, worsted, or poplin. Skirts of thin or clingy fabrics are often worn with slips for better drape and modesty.`,
